/--
Registry mapping imported Python library members to Lean runtime functions/constants.

This plays the same role for imported libraries that `PastaLean.Attributes` plays for
Python methods: codegen consults this table once an AST node has been recognized as
coming from a specific imported module.

/--
Exact-mode (`ℝ`, `noncomputable`) registry for transcendental library members.

In the default numeric mode codegen consults this first; a hit lowers `math.exp` etc. to the
`Real.*`-backed version (provable, not runnable). A miss falls back to `pythonLibraryMap?` (the
regular, often `Float`-valued, mapping) — so non-transcendental members are unaffected.
-/

  | "math" => math.pythonMathMemberMapReal? member
  | "numpy" => numpy.pythonNumpyMemberMapReal? member
  | "scipy" => scipy.pythonScipyMemberMapReal? member
  | _ => none

/-- Exact-mode overrides that are computable + provable but NOT transcendental `ℝ` (e.g.
`math.pow` with an integer exponent → rational power). Consulted in exact mode after the real map
and before the regular (`Float`) map. -/
def pythonLibraryMapExact? (moduleName member : String) : Option Lean.Name :=

  | "math" => math.pythonMathMemberMapExact? member
  | "numpy" => numpy.pythonNumpyMemberMapExact? member
  | _ => none

/-- The `Behaviour` of a **qualified** library member `module.member` — the single record carrying
its return shape, mutation, and iterator kind. Adding a library member is one entry in that library's
own `Mapping.lean`; this dispatch and the derived views below never change. -/

  | _ => none

/-- The `Behaviour` of a BARE callable name (a builtin, or a star-imported library member) — the entry
point TypeInfer consults for a `Name` call. Excludes `math`/`scipy`/`numpy`, which are qualified-only,
so a user function named `pow`/`sqrt`/`dot` is not shadowed by the library. -/

/-- The unbounded-iterator spec of a library member, for the core codegen. -/
def libraryInfiniteIter? (moduleName member : String) : Option InfiniteIter :=
  (memberBehaviour? moduleName member).bind (·.infiniteIter)

/-- Library modules whose members live in `IO` because they read or advance global mutable state
(`random`'s generator). A call to one makes its enclosing function IO-effectful, exactly as
`input()` does. Declared here rather than in the Python driver so a library's facts stay in one
place; the driver reads it over the `libraryInfo` backend task. -/
def ioEffectfulLibraries : List String := ["random"]

/-- Does this member construct a library-owned object (`hashlib.md5()`)? Codegen tags the assigned
variable with the owning module so its methods route through `libraryMethod?`. -/
def libraryObjectConstructor? (moduleName member : String) : Bool :=
  ((memberBehaviour? moduleName member).map (·.constructsObject)).getD false

/-- A METHOD on a library-owned object → its runtime function. Consulted only when the receiver is
a variable known to hold an object of that module, so a name that collides with a builtin method
(`update`) still resolves correctly for ordinary dicts and sets. One entry point, so codegen names
no specific library. -/
def libraryMethod? (moduleName member : String) : Option Lean.Name :=
  match moduleName with
  | "hashlib" => hashlib.hashlibMethod? member
  | _ => none

/-- Does this member wrap a comparator into a sort key (`functools.cmp_to_key`)? Keyed on the member
name alone as well as qualified, since it reaches codegen either way (`from functools import
cmp_to_key` gives a bare name). Lets the core sort lowering unwrap it without naming any library. -/
def isCmpKeyWrapper (member : String) : Bool :=
  ((bareBehaviour? member).map (·.cmpKeyWrapper)).getD false ||
    ((memberBehaviour? "functools" member).map (·.cmpKeyWrapper)).getD false

/-- A method that a library declares as a no-op, for the core codegen — keyed on the method name
alone (these come from decorated values, e.g. `f.cache_clear()`, which carry no module tag). One
entry point, so codegen names no specific library. -/
def libraryNoopMethod? (member : String) : Option Lean.Name :=
  functools.functoolsNoopMethod? member

/-- A `sortedcontainers.SortedList` instance method → its runtime function. Codegen consults this
only when the receiver is a known SortedList (several names collide with set/list/bisect). One entry
point, so codegen names no specific library. -/
def sortedListMethod? (member : String) : Option Lean.Name :=
  sortedcontainers.sortedListMethod? member

/-- A decorator a library declares transparent — no effect on the transpiled value, so the decorated
function is emitted unchanged (e.g. functools' `@cache`). One entry point, so codegen names no
specific library. The caller passes the decorator's last dotted segment (`functools.cache` → `cache`). -/
