# Type-inference behaviour — the Mathlib-free half of the library `Behaviour` records

`TypeInfer` needs only two of a `Behaviour` record's fields — `returns` and `teaches?` (the ones
tagged `[inference]`). The `[codegen]` fields (`mutator`/`keyedVariant`/…) carry *checked* runtime
names (`` ``pyHeapify ``), which drag each library's runtime shim — and, transitively, Mathlib — into
the import closure. Elaborating those names is a code-generation concern the type engine never reads.

So the pure return-shape behaviour of every library member lives here, importing only `PyType` and the
combinators — no runtime, no Mathlib. `Libraries/*/Mapping.lean` keeps the full records (behaviour +
codegen names) for the code generator; `Registry` aggregates those. This module aggregates the
type-only view (`memberTypeBehaviour?`/`bareTypeBehaviour?`/`libraryMemberReturn?`) that
`TypeInfer/Rules.lean` consumes, so the inference engine builds free of the runtime.

Members whose only behaviour is a mutation or a keyed-variant (`heapq.heapify`, all of `bisect`) carry
no `returns`/`teaches?`, so they are simply absent here — the type engine learns nothing from them.
